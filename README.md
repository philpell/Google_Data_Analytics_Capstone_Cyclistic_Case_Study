# Google Data Analytics Capstone Case Study: Cyclistic 
This case study forms the final part of the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics). 

## Aims and Objectives
This report uses data from the [divvy_trip](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) repositry to provide evidence-based insights which will help Cyclistic's marketing team in understanding "How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?"

The key objectives of this report are to provide:
1. A clear statement of the business task
2. A description of all data sources used
3. Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data
4. A summary of the analysis undertaken
5. Provide supporting visualizations and key findings
6. Provide top three recommendations based on the analysis

Throughout this case study, I will perform the typical tasks of a junior data analyst and follow the steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act.

# Background
Since 2016, Cyclistic have been providing a bike-sharing programme that has grown to a fleet of 5,824 geotracked bicycles locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members. Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. 

Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a solid opportunity to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs. Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.
