# Google Data Analytics Capstone Case Study: Cyclistic 
This case study forms the final part of the [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics). 

## Aims and Objectives
This report uses data from the [divvy_trip](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) repositry to provide evidence-based insights which will help Cyclistic's marketing team in understanding "How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?"

The key objectives of this report are to provide:
1. A clear statement of the business task
2. A description of all data sources used
3. Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data
4. A summary of the analysis undertaken
5. Provide supporting visualizations and key findings
6. Provide top three recommendations based on the analysis

Throughout this case study, I will perform the typical tasks of a junior data analyst and follow the steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act.
